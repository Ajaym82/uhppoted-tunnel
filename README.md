# uhppoted-tunnel

_IN DEVELOPMENT_

Tunnels UDP packets between a pair of machines to enable UHPPOTE controller remote access.

Technically it's not really a tunnel, except in the sense that as a packet you enter a dark
forbidding hole, mysterious and possibly unspeakable things occur and you emerge some time
later blinking in the light in an entirely different place. So probably more a relay or a 
proxy .. but we're going with _tunnel_ anyway.

## Raison d'Ãªtre

For those **so** annoying times when it would ne nice to run the UHPPOTE _AccessControl_ application
but the controller is in one place and the host machine is in another (or perhaps on a VPS in Norway) 
which means UDP broadcast doesn't just work. And poking holes in the firewall and/or fixing the NAT
or setting up a VPN is either not going to happen or is more trouble than it's worth.

Also useful for remotely using
- [uhppote-cli](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppote-cli)
- [uhppoted-app-sheets](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted-app-sheets) 
- [uhppoted-app-wildapricot](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted-app-wildapricot)

and is a simpler alternative to:
- [uhppoted-rest](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted-rest)
- [uhppoted-mqtt](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted-mqtt)

## Installation

Executables for all the supported operating systems are packaged in the [releases](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted-tunnel/releases):

The release tarballs contain the executables for all the operating systems - OS specific tarballs with all the _uhppoted_ components can be found in [uhpppoted](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted/releases) releases.

Installation is straightforward - download the archive and extract it to a directory of your choice. To install `uhppoted-tunnel` as a system service:
```
   cd <uhppoted directory>
   sudo uhppoted-tunnel daemonize
```

`uhppoted-tunnel help` will list the available commands and associated options (documented below).

### Building from source

Required tools:
- [Go 1.18+](https://go.dev)
- make (optional but recommended)

To build using the included Makefile:

```
git clone https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted-tunnel.git
cd uhppoted-tunnel
make build
```

Without using `make`:
```
git clone https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted-tunnel.git
cd uhppoted-tunnel
mkdir bin
go build -trimpath -o bin ./...
```

The above commands build the `uhppoted-tunnel` executable to the `bin` directory.

## uhppoted-tunnel

Usage: ```uhppoted-tunnel <command> <options>```

Supported commands:

- `help`
- `version`
- `run`
- `daemonize`
- `undaemonize`

Defaults to `run` if the command it not provided i.e. ```uhppoted-tunnel <options>``` is equivalent to 
```uhppoted-tunnel run <options>```.

### `run`

Runs the `uhppoted-tunnel` service. Default command, intended for use as a system service that runs in the 
background. 

Command line:

` uhppoted-tunnel [--debug] [--console] --udp <UDP spec> --pipe <pipe spec>`

```
  --udp <spec> Defines the tunnel UDP connection. May be: 
               - listen:<UDP bind address> (e.g. --udp listen:0.0.0.0:60000)
               - broadcast:<UDP broadcast address> (e.g. --udp broadcast:192.168.1.255:60005)

  --pipe <spec> Defines the tunnel pair TCP connection. May be: 
                - tcp/server:<TCP bind address> (e.g. --pipe tcp/server:0.0.0.0:12345)
                - tcp/client:<TCP connect address> (e.g. --pipe tcp/client:127.0.0.1:12345)

  --console     Runs the UDP tunnel as a console application, logging events to the console.
  --debug       Displays verbose debugging information, in particular the communications with the 
                UHPPOTE controllers
```

Tunnels operate in pairs - one on the _host_, listening for commands from e.g. the _AccessControl_ application
or _uhppote-cli_ and the other on the _client_ local to the controller, which sends the commands to the controller(s)
and returns the replies to the _host_.

A _normal_ tunnel has the _host_ configured as a TCP server to listen for incoming connections from the client
machine e.g.:
```
host
  uhppoted-tunnel --udp listen:0.0.0.0:60000  --pipe tcp/server:0.0.0.0:12345

client
  uhppoted-tunne; --udp broadcast:192.168.1.255:60005 --pipe tcp/client:127.0.0.1:12345
```

A _reverse_ connection has the _host_ configured as a TCP client, connecting to the _client_ machine e.g.:
```
host
   uhppoted-tunnel --udp listen:0.0.0.0:60000 --pipe tcp/client:127.0.0.1:12345

client
   uhppoted-tunnel --udp broadcast:192.168.1.255:60005 --pipe tcp/server:0.0.0.0:12345
```


### `daemonize`

Registers `uhppoted-tunnel` as a system service that will be started on system boot. The command creates the necessary
system specific service configuration files and service manager entries. On Linux it defaults to using the 
`uhppoted:uhppoted` user:group - this can be changed with the `--user` option

Command line:

`uhppoted-tunnel daemonize [--user <user>]`

### `undaemonize`

Unregisters `uhppoted-tunnel` as a system service, but does not delete any created log or configuration files. 

Command line:

`uhppoted-tunnel undaemonize `
