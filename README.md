# uhppoted-tunnel

Tunnels UDP packets between a pair of machines to enable UHPPOTE controller remote access.

Technically it's not really a tunnel, except in the sense that as a packet you enter a dark
forbidding hole, mysterious and possibly unspeakable things occur and you emerge some time
later blinking in the light in an entirely different place. So probably more a relay or a 
proxy .. but we're going to go with tunnel anyway.

## Raison d'Ãªtre

For those **so** irritating times when your controller is in one place and the host machine is
in another which means UDP broadcast doesn't just work and the network admin is being uncooperative
about poking holes in the firewall and/or fixing the NAT. And:

- you're not really a command line person so [uhppote-cli](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppote-cli) is 
  just not going work for you
- REST is for people who into that kind thing, so nope not doing [uhppoted-rest](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted-rest)
- You've heard of MQTT and want no truck with things of that ilk i.e. [uhppoted-mqtt](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted-mqtt)
  is out
- no respectable person runs their access control system from a [spreadsheet](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted-app-sheets) 
- or [Wild Apricot](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted-app-wildapricot) for that matter
- the UHHPOTE _AccessControl_ application works for you except for this one small thing where you
  have to run it on a machine in a small closet with a whole bunch of electrical cabinets making 
  disturbing humming noises

## Installation

Executables for all the supported operating systems are packaged in the [releases](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted-tunnel/releases):

The release tarballs contain the executables for all the operating systems - OS specific tarballs with all the _uhppoted_ components can be found in [uhpppoted](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted/releases) releases.

Installation is straightforward - download the archive and extract it to a directory of your choice. To install `uhppoted-tunnel` as a system service:
```
   cd <uhppoted directory>
   sudo uhppoted-tunnel daemonize
```

`uhppoted-tunnel help` will list the available commands and associated options (documented below).

### Building from source

Required tools:
- [Go 1.18+](https://go.dev)
- make (optional but recommended)

To build using the included Makefile:

```
git clone https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted-tunnel.git
cd uhppoted-tunnel
make build
```

Without using `make`:
```
git clone https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted-tunnel.git
cd uhppoted-tunnel
go build -trimpath -o bin ./...
```

The above commands build the `uhppoted-tunnel` executable to the `bin` directory.

## uhppoted-tunnel

Usage: ```uhppoted-tunnel <command> <options>```

Supported commands:

- `help`
- `version`
- `run`
- `daemonize`
- `undaemonize`

Defaults to `run` if the command it not provided i.e. ```uhppoted-tunnel <options>``` is equivalent to 
```uhppoted-tunnel run <options>```.

### `run`

Runs the `uhppoted-tunnel` service. Default command, intended for use as a system service that runs in the 
background. 

Command line:

` uhppoted-tunnel [--debug] [--console]`

```
  --console     Runs the HTTP server endpoint as a console application, logging events to the console.
  --debug       Displays verbose debugging information, in particular the communications with the 
                UHPPOTE controllers
```

### `daemonize`

Registers `uhppoted-tunnel` as a system service that will be started on system boot. The command creates the necessary
system specific service configuration files and service manager entries. On Linux it defaults to using the 
`uhppoted:uhppoted` user:group - this can be changed with the `--user` option

Command line:

`uhppoted-tunnel daemonize [--user <user>]`

### `undaemonize`

Unregisters `uhppoted-tunnel` as a system service, but does not delete any created log or configuration files. 

Command line:

`uhppoted-tunnel undaemonize `
